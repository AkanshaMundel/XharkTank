# XharkTank
It is a  simple backend  application where pitchers can pitch their ideas to investors.
Objective
SharkTank is a panel of potential investors, termed as "Sharks", who listen to entrepreneurs pitch ideas for a business or product they wish to develop. These self-made multi-millionaires judge the business concepts and products pitched and then decide whether to invest their own money to help market and mentor each contestant.


DESCRIPTION
Build a Backend of XharkTank where budding entrepreneurs can pitch ideas for a business or product they wish to develop by providing their name, title & idea for the business, the investment amount they expect to be fulfilled, and the percentage of equity they are ready to shed away to the potential investors. Investors must be able to retrieve the list of all pitches and share their feedback/comments with a counter offer as per their interests.


Here I implement the GET/POST APIs required for the backend to function as per the requirements. The below visual gives a high-level idea of the architecture of the Full Stack Application.
